This application automatically creates pixel density variations for Android apps

Source images should be in \res\drawable

Resized images will be saved in their corresponding pixel density drawable directories

Source images will be moved to ARCHIVE_DIRECTORY_NAME then zipped so that Android Studio doesn't complain about them

.exe should be located in the \res\ directory
